Khepera Robot Symulator uses binary protocol to communicate with clients, which can be visualisers or robot controlers. Server listen port is 6020. Immediately after
connecting to server client should provide informations about himself. To do it, he sends packet:

+--------------+
|              |
|  CLIENT_TYPE |
|    8 bytes   |
+--------------+

where client type is:
	* 0 - for robot controlers
	* 1 - for visualisers

This is done to distinguish betwin clients that are interested in receiving whole world description, and those who will only use sensors to get informations about symulation world. Server sends world description, to clients who subscribed as visualisers, every time symulation state is updated (after every time quant). Right now because there are only two type of clients, CLIENT_TYPE value might be interpreted as bool value, which means if client wants to receive world description after every symulation tick.
